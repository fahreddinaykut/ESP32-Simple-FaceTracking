# ESP32-CAM Face Tracking Project

This project utilizes the ESP32-CAM module to implement face tracking without the need for WiFi or any network connectivity. The goal is to achieve efficient and fast face tracking directly on the device.

## Features

- **Face Detection and Tracking:** Uses the ESP32-CAM to detect and track faces in real-time.
- **Standalone Operation:** No WiFi or external connectivity required, ensuring faster processing and response times.
- **Optimized Performance:** Streamlined code to maximize the speed and efficiency of face tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware:**
  - ESP32-CAM module (AI Thinker)
  - USB-to-Serial adapter for programming

- **Software:**
  - Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO extension
 
### Usage
- Power up the ESP32-CAM module.
- The device will start detecting and tracking faces automatically.
- Observe the face tracking performance in real-time on serial port
